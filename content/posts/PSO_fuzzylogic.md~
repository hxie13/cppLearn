# Title:A new hybrid particle swarm optimization and Genetic algorithm method controlled by fuzzy logic  

## Abstract  
- The performance of PSO can be improved by minimizing the possibility of premature convergence in a local minimum.'Modifying some of the particle with crossover and mutation operators used in genetic algorithms'.But, the impact of GA operator on the optimization process depends on the current state of the PSO algorithm.  
- Propose a neuro-fuzzy system to dynamically determine the strengh with which these operators will affect the process of finding the optimal solution.
