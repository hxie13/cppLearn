# Title:A new hybrid particle swarm optimization and Genetic algorithm method controlled by fuzzy logic  

## Abstract  
- The performance of PSO can be improved by minimizing the possibility of premature convergence in a local minimum.'Modifying some of the particle with crossover and mutation operators used in genetic algorithms'.But, the impact of GA operator on the optimization process depends on the current state of the PSO algorithm.  
- Propose a neuro-fuzzy system to dynamically determine the strengh with which these operators will affect the process of finding the optimal solution.

## Introduction  
- PSO has been successfully used to solve problems in various areas such as healthcare, finance, telecommunications, energy, image thresholding and others. Many problems are multidimensional, multimodal or noisy, so they are too complicated for these methods to give a satisfactory solution.  

- PSO is inspired by processes occurring in nature, several studies focus on improving the PSO by increasing the number of particles or changing the method of selecting particles that influence the particle's velocity.  Or, developed hybrid methods combining the PSO with other algorithm.

- Performance of searching can be improved primarily by proper balancing between exploration-searching for regions that potentially contain the optimum solution, and exploitation-improving the solution inside a limited area.
